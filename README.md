## then write your CI/CD code in your .yml file 

```
name: calculator-app-in-react
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Adjust branch name as needed
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 16

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build React App
      run: npm run build

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        BRANCH: gh-pages
        FOLDER: public  # The folder where the build artifacts are located

# also to deploy your application you will have to go to pages and then choose deploy from branch and choose branch as gh-pages and then save


#then you have to go to package.json and have to paste your url as homepage there

```
"homepage" : "your_url"
"Homepage (Web brower):https://tarunkamur.github.io/calculator-app-in-react/"


## now you CI/CD pipeline using github actions has been built successfully and when you push anything it will automatically go through the stages and deployed successfully.
